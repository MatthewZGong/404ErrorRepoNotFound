1. A goal management game. Users can bet with other users whether or not they can accomplish a goal. 
If they succeed they win, otherwise they lose. They can do this with multiple users. Plenty of uses for CRUD here.

2. A Meal Management system. You can track your food, find recipes posted by others that fit certain criteria etc.
This would be pretty straightforward to do and most of the work I imagine will be on the database side.

3. An idle game could be fun to make. Could make it so its possible to interact with other users and more currency 
is generated the longer you wait since you last logged in.
