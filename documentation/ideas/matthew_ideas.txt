1. App that displays the most recent jobs postings:
We would design a web scrapper that would scrap for all open jobs and store them in a database.
Then create a server that would allow clients(probably a website) to pull the recent job posting. 
This will probably be only for software engineering jobs 

2. A better auto grader
Basically creating a website like leetcode or like Anubis
This idea comes from being a TA and talking to other TAs. 
We would have a website that allowed students to upload code to the website for a certain problem 
Then we would run an auto grader on it.
Would have a data base would store questions, students code, students scores etc

3. Making a card game 
Mostly because I want to get experience setting up a server like this, but any card game would work
I was thinking poker because its sounds fun, but idk if thats allowed because of gambling.
